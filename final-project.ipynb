    "\n",
    "So how can you truly be safe when that Day comes? Thankfully, there are ways to determine just how survivable a neighborhood would be in the Zombie Apocalypse. In this report, we'll look at the presence of steps, retaining walls, and trees as physical features that improve a neighborhood's SI, or Survivability Index.\n",

    "First, we need a definitive metric for determining which neighborhood is the safest. Let's think about each physical feature in terms of how you can use it to your advantage when the zombies come for you and use it to come up with a mathematical equation for our SI.\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "![steps](https://tools.wprdc.org/images/pittsburgh/steps/Glenhurst_Rd_to_Lougean_Ave.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps are awesome because zombies can't climb them well. They sort of shuffle their feet when they walk, allowing you to smash them in the skull with a hockey stick or pepper them with throwing stars. For this reason, stairs are essential when it comes to zombie combat, or ZomCom. Getting the high ground on stairs during a swarm could not only save your life, but make the fight incredibly boring. We'll give good stairs a weight of 10 in our equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retaining Walls\n",
    "\n",
    "![retaining-wall](https://tools.wprdc.org/images/pittsburgh/retaining_walls/Woodville_Ave_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retaining walls can be a double-edged sword. If you're at the bottom of one, it can leave you trapped with no way out. However, being stuck against a retaining wall can often be much better than being entirely surrounded by zombies. If you can get your back against one and find something heavy to swing, your odds of survival increase dramatically. Let's give good retaining walls a weight of 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "![tree](https://www.arborday.org/trees/lifestages/images/figure-life-stages.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are tricky, too; they can be good to climb in a pinch if you're stuck with nowhere else to go, but you need either a ranged weapon or something with a long reach to get out of the situation alive once you're in the tree. Still, they could save your life in the Zombie Apocalypse, too, so we'll give climbable trees a weight of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One more thing to consider:** not all neighborhoods are the same size. 100 trees in a neighborhood of 1 square mile is far more valuable than 200 trees in a neighorhood of 12 square miles, since you're more likely to have a tree within a usable distance in the first neighborhood. After calculating the weights, we'll divide by the area of the neighborhood in square miles to reach our final SI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our weights and are aware of area differences between neighborhoods, we can calculate the SI of any neighborhood with the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`i = (10s + 7r + 4t) / a`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `s` is the number of usable steps in the neighborhood, `r` is the number of viable retaining walls, `t` is the number of climbable trees, and `a` is the area of the neighborhood in square miles."
