They sort of shuffle their feet when they walk, allowing you to smash them in the skull with a hockey stick or pepper them with throwing stars. For this reason, stairs are essential when it comes to zombie combat, or ZomCom. Getting the high ground on stairs during a swarm could not only save your life, but make the fight incredibly boring. We'll give good stairs a weight of 5 in our equation.\n",

However, being stuck against a retaining wall can often be much better than being entirely surrounded by zombies. If you can get your back against one and find something heavy to swing, your odds of survival increase dramatically. Let's give good retaining walls a weight of 5.\n",

Still, they could save your life in the Zombie Apocalypse, too, so we'll give climbable trees a weight of .2, since they're so numerous in a lot of places.\n",
